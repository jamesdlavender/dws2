				Attila is an American metalcore/deathcore band from Atlanta, Georgia, who were formed in 2005. Frontman Chris Fronzak started the band in high school; he and Sean Heenan are the only original members. They have released five full-length albums.
				In 2011, Fronzak was featured in the From The Embrace song "La Flama Blanca", which appeared on the band's "The Grind" EP. In 2012, Fronzak was featured in the In Dying Arms song "Bathed in Salt", which appeared on the band's album Boundaries released in September 2012. He also featured in the song "Love, Sex, Riot" from Issues' debut EP Black Diamonds, which was released on November 13. Fronzak was also featured in the We Are The Blog! song "Shwash" in their EP Decadence. Also Fronzak featured in "Mimic" from Upon A Burning Body's 2012 album Red.White.Green. He also featured in My City, My Secret's song "The Forefront", in their debut EP Dream Being. On October 30, Attila released a new song via iTunes, called "Party With the Devil", along with a re-recorded version of the song "Soda In The Water Cup". In 2013, Fronz was also featured in Sleeping With Sirens song "Best There Ever Was" off their latest album, "Feel."
				Their song titles, such as "Rage", can be interpreted different ways. Attila wants "the listener to take away the message in whatever context they find fitting". “The title can be perceived in many ways, one obviously being a state of extreme anger, and the other being the slang meaning – to party! I have always been a fan of play-on-words and double meanings, and that’s what drew me to this title more than anything,” Fronzak said.

            <h2>Abandon All Ships</h2>

                Abandon All Ships are a Canadian Hardcore band from Toronto, Ontario. Formed in 2006, the group is currently signed domestically to Universal Music Canada via Underground Operations, along with an American deal to Rise Records and its imprint Velocity Records. The band has since released a self-titled EP independently in 2009 and two full-length studio albums, Geeving in 2010 through Universal and Rise, and also Infamous in 2012.
				Abandon All Ships was founded in 2006 in Toronto, Ontario, originally playing covers of Norma Jean songs. Most of the band members attended Dante Alighieri Catholic Secondary, including lead vocalist Angelo Aita, keyboardist Sebastian Cassisi-Nunez, and original guitarist David Stephens. The three just started the band to play gigs and their career escalated from there. By 2008, the band released four demo songs online, which were "Megawacko", "When Dreams Become Nightmares", "Brendon's Song" and "Pedestrians Is Another Word for Speedbump". These demos featured a heavy mathcore influence (especially "When Dreams Become Nightmares"), which differs highly from the band's current post-hardcore/electronicore style. After rising in the Toronto scene, the group eventually toured and opened for many larger bands in their same genre or home country such as Silverstein.
				Abandon All Ships widely were thought to be a Christian band, but this is controversial due to the band's regular use of profanity and suggestive lyrics in their songs and eventually settled the debate that while a majority of the members are Christians, the band is not a Christian band. Abandon All Ships quickly became popular on the Internet through Myspace, and were noticed even more after their appearance on the MuchMusic's television program Disband early-on in their career.

				Of Mice & Men is an American metalcore band from Costa Mesa, California. The group was founded by Austin Carlile and Jaxin Hall during mid-2009 after Carlile's departure from Attack Attack!. The name of the band is derived from John Steinbeck's novel of the same title.
				Of Mice & Men was founded by Austin Carlile, the original vocalist of Attack Attack!, and bassist Jaxin Hall, an import from Auckland, New Zealand during 2009 in Columbus, Ohio. The two recorded their demo "Seven Thousand Miles for What?" with the band Though She Wrote at Paper Tiger Studios in Columbus. Carlile and Hall searched for other members for about a month. They came across Valentino Arteaga, drummer of Lower Definition, Jon Kintz of Odd Project, and Phil Manansala, a touring guitarist for A Static Lullaby. Carlile and Hall moved to Southern California to join up with the three. A little while later, Kintz was cut from the band and replaced with Shayley Bourget. With a question at hand asking of the departure of Kintz in a Q&A for the group, Bourget jokingly stated "Jon didn't cut it." On Kintz's part, he reportedly cited that the band felt he was "partying too much." After reaching 1,000,000 plays from their Myspace profile in just two months since its launch, the band uploaded a cover of Lady Gaga's song, "Poker Face". The song was mastered by Tom Denney, formerly of A Day to Remember and a copy of the demo was sent directly to Rise Records. Recognizing the band as Carlile's new musical project, Of Mice & Men was signed to the label. The group then traveled to the Foundation Studios in Connersville, Indiana on July 14, 2009, with Joey Sturgis to record their self-titled debut album.
				On December 6, 2009 they had two video shoots in Ventura, California for "Those in Glass Houses" and "Second & Sebring". The band released their debut album on March 9, 2010 even though they planned on releasing it earlier. The album was originally intended to be released on February 23, however it was forced into a delay just days before its release, but leaked on February 10, 2010 by fans that hacked into the system. The music video for "Second & Sebring" was released on Hot Topic's website and made its television premiere on Headbangers Ball on March 15, 2010.
